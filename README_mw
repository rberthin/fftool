in file il.ff: 

* you can add fumi-tosi potential (keyword ft, parameters in kJ/mol)
* last column correspond to atomic polarizability (with lj and ft)
* lj potential and intramolecular potential are in other units than u.a. 
	!! (need to add the conversion to u.a. for lj potential) !!

* need to udpate the data file to the last version of mw
* add constraint/harmonic intra
* for polarizability : if last column=null than polarizability = 0
