in file il.ff: 

* you can add fumi-tosi potential (keyword ft, parameters in kJ/mol)
* last column correspond to atomic polarizability in A3 (with lj and ft).
	if no pol put 0.
* potentials parameters are in kJ/mol, A, deg 

* need to udpate the data file to the last version of mw
* add constraint/harmonic intra
